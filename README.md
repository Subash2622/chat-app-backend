# Spring Boot Chat Application 🗣️💬

This is a **Spring Boot** chat application where multiple people can join a room, chat, create rooms, and leave rooms. 🌍

## Features ⚡
- Users can **join** a room and start chatting. 💬
- Users can **create** new rooms. 🏠
- Users can **leave** a room at any time. 🚪
- **MongoDB** is used as the database for storing chat data. 🗄️

## Frontend 🚀
For the frontend, I used **React**. All the React code and related details are available in another repository. You can refer to that repository for the frontend implementation and details:
